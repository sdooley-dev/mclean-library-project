# mclean-library-project

Here are the 3 main objectives of the McLean Library Management System project:
1. The ability to track multiple copies of the same book title.
2. The ability to track the branch location of a particular book (expect to have multiple branches)
3. The ability to track individual library patrons and see current and previous lending activity.
